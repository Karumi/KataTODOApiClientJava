![Karumi logo][karumilogo] KataTODOApiClient for Java [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataTODOApiClientJava.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataTODOApiClientJava)
============================

- We are here to practice integration testing using HTTP stubbing. 
- We are going to use [MockWebServer][mockwebserver] to simulate a HTTP server.
- We are going to use [JUnit][junit] to perform assertions.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains an API client to interact with a remote service we can use to implement a TODO application.

This API Client is based on one class with name ``TodoApiClient`` containing some methods to interact with the API. Using this class we can get all the tasks we have created before, get a task using the task id, add a new task, update a task or delete an already created task.

The API client has been implemented using a networking framework named [Retrofit][retrofit]. Review the project documentation if needed.

## Tasks

Your task as Java Developer is to **write all the integration tests** needed to check if the API Client is working as it should. 

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**

Our recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Fork this repository.
    2. Checkout `kata-todo-api-client` branch.
    3. Execute the repository playground and make yourself familiar with the code.
    4. Execute `TodoApiClientTest` and watch the only test it contains pass.

  * To help you get started, these are some tests already written at `TodoApiClientTest ` class. Review it carefully before to start writing your own tests. Here you have the description of some tests you can write to start working on this Kata:
	1. Test that the ``Accept`` and ``ContentType`` headers are sent.
    2. Test that the list of ``TaskDto`` instances obtained invoking the method ``getAllTasks``  contains the expected values.
    3. Test that the request is sent to the correct path using the correct HTTP method.
    4. Test that adding a task the body sent to the server is the correct one.

## Considerations

* If you get stuck, `master` branch contains all the tests already solved.

* You will find some utilities to help you test the APIClient easily in:
  ``MockWebServerTes`` and the test resources directory.

## Extra Tasks

If you've covered all the application functionality using integration tests you can continue with some extra tasks: 

* Replace some integration tests we have created with unit tests. A starting point could be the ``DefaultHeadersInterceptor`` class.
* Create your own API client to consume one of the services described in this web: [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/][jsonplaceholder]
